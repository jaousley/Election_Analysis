## Election-Audit Summary 
Moving forward this script can be used, with some modifications, for any election. The script has provided a clean way to organize and view election data. It can be used in federal elections by adding in state by state results alongside the top 3 county results in each state. This can serve as a resource for each state on where to focus "go vote" or "right to vote" campaigns during future elections by knowning which states or counties historically vote less. 

The data could also be modified using more if-then statements to determine which candidate received the most votes in a specific county or state. This could help reveal patterns for states or counties that repeatedly vote for the same political party over time. It will help future candidates understand which states or counties they will have the most luck and also get the most push back.
